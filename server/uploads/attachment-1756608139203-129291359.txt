A sealed Nutella jar begins to vibrate gently, then bursts openâ€”releasing a rich explosion of swirling chocolate, roasted hazelnuts, toast slices, strawberries, and golden syrup. The ingredients twirl mid-air in gravity-defying slow motion, assembling into a picture-perfect Nutella breakfast platter on a rustic wooden table.",
